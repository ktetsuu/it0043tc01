    <span class="white">The Tortured Poets Department.</span> An Anthology of a new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments 
    from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time - one that was both sensational and sorrowful measure. 
    There is nothing to avange, no score to settle once wounds have heald. This writer is of the firm belief that 
    out tears become holy in the form of ink page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it.
